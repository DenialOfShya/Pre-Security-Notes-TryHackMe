I spent the past week completing the pre security learning path on TryHackMe.com
While completing the beginner friendly modules I assembled 88 pages worth of notes with simplified explanations.
The attatched PDF file is attended for people with no prior knowledge and experianced proffesionals who havnt touched the basics in some time that could use a refresher.
Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
I wish you the best of luck starting your carrer in this exciting field.
Best wishes :)
